# Example - Database Actions

This example is utilizing Actions for [Robocorp Action Server](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/tree/master/action_server/docs#readme).

`Actions` and `Action Server` enable you to "give your AI Agents hands" meaning that your AI/LLM Agent can help your users perform distinct actions that get executed based on the LLM discussion.

## Quickstart

ðŸ‘‰ Follow the Action Server [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-quickstart) in the main repository.

## What does this example Database Action do?

This example can get the schema of your local SQLite databases and create queries for those.

There are two example databases included, `music.db` and `cars.db`. 

Example prompt flow:  
- "What is the first AC/DC album in the music.db?" 
- "What songs does it have?" 
- "Who was the latest customer to buy it?" 
- "What brands are there in cars.db?" 
- "Which artist has the most songs in the store?"
